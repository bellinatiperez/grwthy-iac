# Authentication

All API requests require an `X-Api-Key` header.

## API Key Types

### Master API Key

The master key provides full access to all endpoints, including account management (create, update, delete accounts).

```bash
X-Api-Key: YOUR_MASTER_API_KEY
```

**Used for:**
- Creating and managing accounts (`/accounts/*`)
- Listing templates for any account
- Administrative operations

### Account API Key

Each account receives a unique API key when created (format: `wk_<64-char-hex>`). This key is scoped to a single account.

```bash
X-Api-Key: wk_a1b2c3d4...
```

**Used for:**
- Sending messages (`/messages/*`)
- Listing templates (`/templates`)

## Error Responses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `401` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | API key does not have permission for this endpoint |

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Missing X-Api-Key header"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

- Store API keys in environment variables, never in source code
- Rotate account API keys periodically using `POST /accounts/:id/regenerate-key`
- Use the master key only for administrative operations
- Use account-specific keys for sending messages
