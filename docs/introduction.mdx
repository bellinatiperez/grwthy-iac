# Grwthy WhatsApp API

Grwthy provides a multi-account WhatsApp Business Cloud API that simplifies sending and receiving messages at scale.

## Key Features

- **Multi-account support** — Manage multiple WhatsApp Business accounts from a single API
- **10+ message types** — Text, templates, images, documents, audio, video, location, contacts, interactive buttons/lists, reactions
- **Reliable delivery** — Messages are processed asynchronously with automatic retries
- **Webhook integration** — Receive incoming messages and delivery status updates in real-time
- **Secure credentials** — Access tokens and app secrets are encrypted at rest
- **Per-account API keys** — Each account gets its own API key for isolated access

## How It Works

1. **Outbound**: You send a message via the API → Grwthy validates, delivers to WhatsApp, and tracks status
2. **Inbound**: A user messages your WhatsApp number → Grwthy verifies the webhook and delivers the event to your system

## Base URL

## Rate Limiting

The API applies rate limiting of **100 requests per 60 seconds** per client. Exceeding this limit returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
