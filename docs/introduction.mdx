# Grwthy WhatsApp API

Grwthy provides a powerful, multi-account WhatsApp Business Cloud API wrapper that simplifies sending and receiving messages at scale.

## Key Features

- **Multi-account support** — Manage multiple WhatsApp Business accounts from a single API
- **10+ message types** — Text, templates, images, documents, audio, video, location, contacts, interactive buttons/lists, reactions
- **Asynchronous processing** — Messages are queued via BullMQ for reliable delivery with automatic retries
- **Webhook integration** — Receive incoming messages and delivery status updates in real-time
- **Encrypted credentials** — Access tokens and app secrets are stored with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Per-account API keys** — Each account gets its own API key for isolated access

## Architecture

```
Client → API (NestJS) → Queue (BullMQ/Redis) → WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta)
                                                        ↓
                                               Webhook → Queue → Event Processing
```

### Request Flow

1. **Outbound**: Client sends message → API validates and queues → Worker processes and sends to Meta → Status tracked in database
2. **Inbound**: Meta sends webhook → Signature verified → Message queued → Logged and event emitted

## Base URL

```

## Rate Limiting

The API applies rate limiting of **100 requests per 60 seconds** per client. Exceeding this limit will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
