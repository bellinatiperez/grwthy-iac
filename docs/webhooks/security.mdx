# Webhook Security

All incoming webhook requests from Meta are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## How It Works

1. Meta signs each webhook payload using your app's **App Secret**
2. The signature is sent in the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header
3. Grwthy verifies the signature before processing any event

```
Meta → POST https://grwthy.com/whatsapp/webhook
       Header: X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hmac_hex>
       Body: { ... webhook payload ... }
                    ↓
       Signature verified per-account
                    ↓
       ✅ Match → event processed
       ❌ Mismatch → 403 Forbidden
```

## Signature Format

The `X-Hub-Signature-256` header contains:

```
sha256=<hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash>
```

## Verification

The signature is verified per-account using the `appSecret` you provided when [creating the account](/api-reference/accounts#create-account). The account is identified by the `phone_number_id` in the webhook payload.

## Error Responses

| Status | Scenario |
|--------|----------|
| `403` | Missing `X-Hub-Signature-256` header |
| `403` | No account found for the phone number ID in the payload |
| `403` | Account is inactive |
| `403` | Signature does not match |

## App Secret Management

- The App Secret is stored securely and encrypted — it is never exposed in API responses
- Set during [account creation](/api-reference/accounts#create-account) via the `appSecret` field
- Can be updated via `PATCH /whatsapp/accounts/:id` if rotated in Meta

<Warning>
If you rotate your App Secret in Meta's App Dashboard, update it immediately via the API to avoid webhook verification failures.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- Keep your App Secret synchronized between Meta and Grwthy
- Monitor webhook `403` errors — they may indicate misconfigured secrets
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints (enforced by Meta)
