# Webhook Setup

Configure your Meta App to send WhatsApp events (incoming messages and delivery statuses) to Grwthy.

## 1. Set the Webhook URL

In your [Meta App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/), navigate to:

**WhatsApp** > **Configuration** > **Webhook**

Set the callback URL to:

```
https://grwthy.com/whatsapp/webhook
```

## 2. Set the Verify Token

Use the `webhookVerifyToken` you defined when [creating the account](/api-reference/accounts#create-account).

Meta will send a verification request to confirm ownership:

```
GET https://grwthy.com/whatsapp/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=YOUR_TOKEN&hub.challenge=CHALLENGE_STRING
```

The API echoes back the `hub.challenge` value to complete verification.

## 3. Subscribe to Events

Subscribe to the following webhook fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `messages` | Incoming messages and delivery status updates |

## 4. Verify Setup

Send a test message to your WhatsApp number. You should see:

1. The incoming message delivered to your webhook
2. The message available in your message history via `GET /whatsapp/accounts/:id/messages`

## How Events Are Processed
